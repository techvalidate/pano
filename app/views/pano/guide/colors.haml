  %h5 Where Colors Are Defined
  %p The colors in use in the app are defined in stylesheets/variables/_app.sass.
  %hr

  %h5 CSS Variables and Classes
  %p
    The colors are defined as css variables, and each color also has a css class named after it.
    So, if you're defining styles you can reference the css variable in your SASS, but if you just want
    to color something in your HAML, you can add the appropriate css class.

        .foo

  %h6 Using a CSS Color Class in HAML

  %ol.numbered
    %li A css variable in stylesheets/variables/_app.sass
    %li A css class named after the color in stylesheets/variables/_app.sass
    %li A color swatch here
